# Business Case

## Problem Statement
Organizations face increasing challenges with phishing attacks and data governance. Cybercriminals constantly evolve their tactics, making it difficult for static or outdated models to detect new threats effectively. Furthermore, compliance with evolving data privacy laws requires adaptable governance frameworks.

## Solution
The HAMF Framework provides:
1. **Scalable Data Processing:** Handles large volumes of data in real time.
2. **Ethical Machine Learning:** Ensures bias-free model training and decision-making.
3. **Privacy Compliance:** Adheres to global standards (e.g., GDPR).
4. **Continuous Model Retraining:** Maintains high accuracy and performance by adapting to emerging threats and data patterns.

## Why Continuous Retraining Matters
Machine learning models degrade in performance over time when the data distribution changesâ€”a phenomenon known as **concept drift**. In the context of phishing detection:
- Attack patterns evolve, leading to **lower detection rates**.
- Without retraining, the system becomes inefficient and fails to identify new threats accurately.
- Regular updates ensure the model remains robust and effective.

## Benefits
1. **Cost Efficiency:** Leverages open-source tools, reducing licensing costs.
2. **Adaptability:** Continuous retraining keeps models up-to-date with new phishing patterns.
3. **Flexibility:** Modular architecture allows for easy customization and integration of new datasets.
4. **Proactive Monitoring:** Real-time alerts highlight performance drops, triggering retraining workflows.

## Risks of Not Retraining
1. **Decreased Accuracy:** Static models fail to adapt to new patterns.
2. **Reduced Trust:** Inefficient models erode user confidence in the system.
3. **Compliance Risks:** Outdated models may not meet evolving regulatory requirements.

## Key Differentiators of HAMF
- **Automated Retraining Pipelines:** Integrates data collection, preprocessing, and retraining seamlessly.
- **Real-Time Performance Monitoring:** Prometheus and Grafana track metrics, ensuring timely updates.
- **Ethical AI Practices:** Utilizes tools like AI Fairness 360 to avoid bias during retraining.

## Use Cases
1. **Phishing Detection System:** Deploy HAMF to detect and prevent phishing attacks, with retraining workflows triggered by performance thresholds.
2. **Compliance Reporting:** Ensure adherence to privacy laws with automated governance tools.
3. **Adaptive Security Systems:** Maintain up-to-date defenses against emerging threats through regular retraining.
4. **Continuous Improvement in AI Models:** Integrate new data to refine model accuracy and robustness over time.
